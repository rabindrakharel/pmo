## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture & Data Model

### 5-Layer Database Architecture

The PMO platform implements a sophisticated **5-layer data architecture** that governs all system operations, from UI generation to access control:

#### **üìä Architecture Flow**
```
meta_entity_types (12 entity types)
    ‚Üì Foundation Layer
meta_entity_hierarchy (parent‚Üíchild creation rules)
    ‚Üì Rules Layer  
meta_entity_hierarchy_permission_mapping (permission matrix expansion)
    ‚Üì Permission Layer
entity_id_hierarchy_mapping (actual instance relationships)
    ‚Üì Instance Layer
rel_employee_entity_action_rbac (specific user grants)
    ‚Üì Access Control Layer
```

#### **üîÑ Layer Relationships**

**Layer 1: meta_entity_types (Foundation)**
- Defines the **12 entity types** that drive the entire system
- Controls sidebar navigation structure (4 categories: Organizational, Operational, Personnel, Content)
- Provides validation backbone for all other system tables
- Determines which entities can be created, viewed, and managed in the UI

**Layer 2: meta_entity_hierarchy (Rules)**  
- Establishes **parent‚Üíchild creation relationships** between entity types
- Defines which entities can create other entities (e.g., Business units can create Projects, Wikis, Tasks)
- Controls the appearance of "Create Child Entity" buttons in management pages
- Provides the foundation for hierarchical permission inheritance

**Layer 3: meta_entity_hierarchy_permission_mapping (Permissions)**
- Expands hierarchy rules into **granular permission actions**: create, view, edit, share
- Implements **self-permissions** (entity = parent_entity) for management operations
- Implements **creation permissions** (entity ‚â† parent_entity) for child entity generation
- Controls UI button visibility and API endpoint authorization

**Layer 4: entity_id_hierarchy_mapping (Instances)**
- Maps **actual entity instance relationships** using specific IDs
- Links parent_entity_id to action_entity_id for real data relationships
- Enables **scoped permission boundaries** (e.g., permissions on specific projects, not all projects)
- Supports breadcrumb navigation and hierarchical data filtering

**Layer 5: rel_employee_entity_action_rbac (Access Control)**
- Grants **specific employees** specific **permission actions** on specific **entity instances**
- Final enforcement layer for all system access control
- Validates against all previous layers to ensure data integrity
- Enables real-time permission checking across UI and API

#### **üéØ Entity Categories in Practice**

**Organizational Entities (4 types)**
- **HR (hr)**: Human resources departments and personnel management functions
- **Business (biz)**: Business units, departments, and operational divisions  
- **Organization (org)**: Geographic organizations, locations, and territorial structures
- **Client (client)**: Customer relationships and external business partnerships

**Operational Entities (3 types)**
- **Project (project)**: Structured initiatives with timelines, budgets, and deliverables
- **Task (task)**: Discrete work units within projects or operational processes
- **Worksite (worksite)**: Physical locations where work is performed

**Personnel Entities (2 types)**
- **Employee (employee)**: Individual personnel records and organizational assignments
- **Role (role)**: Job functions, permission sets, and organizational positions

**Content Entities (3 types)**
- **Wiki (wiki)**: Knowledge base articles and collaborative documentation
- **Form (form)**: Dynamic data collection mechanisms and structured input forms
- **Artifact (artifact)**: Documents, designs, and stored knowledge assets

### Permission System in Action

#### **Example: Creating a Project Wiki**

1. **Foundation Check**: System validates that 'project' and 'wiki' are valid entity types (meta_entity_types)
2. **Hierarchy Check**: System confirms that projects can create wikis (meta_entity_hierarchy)  
3. **Permission Check**: System verifies 'create' permission exists for project‚Üíwiki (meta_entity_hierarchy_permission_mapping)
4. **Instance Check**: System validates that the specific project exists and user has access (entity_id_hierarchy_mapping)
5. **User Authorization**: System confirms the employee has 'create' permission on this specific project (rel_employee_entity_action_rbac)
6. **UI Rendering**: "Create Wiki" button appears on the project management page
7. **Action Execution**: User can successfully create a wiki within the project scope

#### **Example: Business Unit Permissions**

A department manager with business unit permissions can:
- **View** their business unit details and metrics (self-permission: biz‚Üíbiz, view)
- **Edit** their business unit configuration (self-permission: biz‚Üíbiz, edit) 
- **Create** projects within their business unit (creation permission: biz‚Üíproject, create)
- **Create** tasks for departmental operations (creation permission: biz‚Üítask, create)
- **Create** wiki content for departmental documentation (creation permission: biz‚Üíwiki, create)

But they cannot:
- View or edit other business units (no RBAC grant on other business unit instances)
- Create HR employees (no hierarchy relationship: biz‚Üíemployee)
- Delete projects (no permission mapping: biz‚Üíproject, delete)

This layered architecture ensures **data consistency**, **security**, and **scalable permissions** while enabling **dynamic UI generation** and **flexible organizational structures**.
