# Complete IAM Setup for Deployment User

## Current Situation

We successfully created a comprehensive IAM policy named **`cohuron-deployment-policy`** that includes all necessary permissions for Cohuron infrastructure deployment.

**However**, after detaching some old policies, the `deployment-user` lost IAM self-management permissions and cannot attach the new policy.

**Policy ARN**: `arn:aws:iam::957207443425:policy/cohuron-deployment-policy`

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

1. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive IAM policy: `cohuron-deployment-policy`
2. ‚úÖ Detached 6 old AWS managed policies:
   - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
   - AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
   - AmazonSSMFullAccess
   - AmazonEC2FullAccess
   - AmazonRDSFullAccess
   - IAMFullAccess
3. ‚ùå Cannot complete due to lost IAM permissions

---

## üîß Complete This Setup in AWS Console

### Step 1: Log into AWS Console as Admin

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Log in with your **root account** or an **admin user** (NOT deployment-user)
3. Navigate to **IAM** ‚Üí **Users** ‚Üí **deployment-user**

### Step 2: Attach the New Comprehensive Policy

1. Click on **deployment-user**
2. Go to **Permissions** tab
3. Click **Add permissions** ‚Üí **Attach policies directly**
4. In the search box, type: **cohuron-deployment-policy**
5. ‚úÖ Check the box next to `cohuron-deployment-policy`
6. Click **Add permissions**

### Step 3: Remove Remaining Old Policies

Currently attached (need to remove):
- ‚úÖ AmazonRoute53FullAccess (already removed)
- ‚úÖ AmazonRedshiftFullAccess (already removed)
- ‚úÖ AmazonSSMFullAccess (already removed)
- ‚úÖ AmazonEC2FullAccess (already removed)
- ‚úÖ AmazonRDSFullAccess (already removed)
- ‚úÖ IAMFullAccess (already removed)
- ‚ùå AmazonSQSFullAccess (still attached - remove)
- ‚ùå AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess (still attached - remove)
- ‚ùå AmazonS3FullAccess (still attached - remove)
- ‚ùå AmazonBedrockFullAccess (still attached - remove)
- ‚ùå AWSLambda_FullAccess (still attached - remove)

For each policy to remove:
1. Click the **X** next to the policy name
2. Confirm removal

### Step 4: Verify Final Configuration

After completion, `deployment-user` should have **ONLY ONE** policy attached:
- ‚úÖ `cohuron-deployment-policy`

This single policy provides ALL necessary permissions:
- EC2 Full Access
- S3 Full Access
- RDS Full Access
- Lambda Full Access
- **EventBridge Full Access** (NEW - needed for deployment automation)
- CloudWatch Full Access (NEW)
- Route53 Full Access
- SSM Full Access
- IAM Management
- VPC Full Access
- ELB, Auto Scaling, CloudFront
- WAF, SNS, SQS, KMS
- Secrets Manager, ACM
- And more...

---

## üöÄ After Setup - Complete Deployment Automation

Once the IAM policy is attached, return to your terminal and run:

```bash
cd /home/rabin/projects/pmo/infra-tf

# Complete the deployment infrastructure
terraform apply -auto-approve

# Test deployment automation
./deploy-code.sh
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Create EventBridge rule (now has permission)
2. ‚úÖ Create EventBridge target
3. ‚úÖ Create Lambda permission
4. ‚úÖ Enable automatic code deployment

---

## üìã What the Comprehensive Policy Includes

The `cohuron-deployment-policy` provides full access to:

| Service Category | Permissions |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Compute** | EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling |
| **Storage** | S3, EBS, Backup |
| **Database** | RDS, ElastiCache |
| **Networking** | VPC, Route53, ELB, CloudFront |
| **Security** | IAM, WAF, ACM, Secrets Manager, KMS |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch, CloudWatch Logs, EventBridge |
| **Management** | SSM, Systems Manager |
| **Messaging** | SNS, SQS |

**Total Services**: 20+ AWS services

## üéØ Simplified Comparison

### Before (11 Policies - Exceeded Quota)
```
‚úó AmazonEC2FullAccess
‚úó AmazonS3FullAccess
‚úó AmazonRDSFullAccess
‚úó AmazonRoute53FullAccess
‚úó AmazonSSMFullAccess
‚úó IAMFullAccess
‚úó AWSLambda_FullAccess
‚úó AmazonSQSFullAccess
‚úó AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
‚úó AmazonBedrockFullAccess
‚úó AmazonRedshiftFullAccess
```

### After (1 Policy - Within Quota)
```
‚úì cohuron-deployment-policy (includes ALL above + MORE)
```

## üìû Alternative: AWS CLI Method (If You Have Admin Credentials)

If you have AWS CLI credentials for an admin user, you can complete this via terminal:

```bash
# Attach the new policy
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name deployment-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::957207443425:policy/cohuron-deployment-policy

# Remove old policies
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name deployment-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSQSFullAccess
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name deployment-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name deployment-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3FullAccess
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name deployment-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonBedrockFullAccess
aws iam detach-user-policy --user-name deployment-user --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSLambda_FullAccess

# Verify
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name deployment-user
```

---

## üîç Verification

After completing the setup, verify with:

```bash
# Check current policies
aws --profile cohuron iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name deployment-user

# Should show only:
# - cohuron-deployment-policy
```

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know the setup is complete when:
1. ‚úÖ Only `cohuron-deployment-policy` is attached to deployment-user
2. ‚úÖ `terraform apply` completes without IAM errors
3. ‚úÖ EventBridge rule is created successfully
4. ‚úÖ `./deploy-code.sh` uploads code and triggers deployment

---

## üìù Policy Location

The policy document is saved at:
```
/home/rabin/projects/pmo/infra-tf/cohuron-deployment-policy.json
```

If you need to update or recreate it, the file is version-controlled and ready to use.

---

## üéâ Next Steps After IAM Setup

1. **Attach policy in AWS Console** (5 minutes)
2. **Remove old policies** (2 minutes)
3. **Run terraform apply** (3 minutes)
4. **Test deployment** (5 minutes)
5. **Deploy your application** with `./deploy-code.sh` üöÄ

Total time: ~15 minutes to complete full deployment automation!
