- ✅ **S3 Artifacts Bucket**: cohuron-artifacts-prod-957207443425
- ✅ **S3 Code Bucket**: cohuron-code-46en2lnm
- ✅ **Route 53 DNS**: app.cohuron.com
- ✅ **Lambda Deployer**: cohuron-code-deployer
- ✅ **EventBridge Automation**: Triggers on S3 upload

### 2. Automated Deployment System (100% Working)
- ✅ **Upload Script**: `./infra-tf/deploy-code.sh`
- ✅ **S3 Upload**: Successfully uploads code bundles
- ✅ **EventBridge Trigger**: Automatically triggers Lambda within ~30 seconds
- ✅ **Lambda Execution**: Successfully sends SSM commands to EC2
- ✅ **EC2 Deployment**: Code deployed to `/opt/cohuron`
- ✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Both API and Web dependencies installed via pnpm

### 3. IAM Permissions (100% Complete)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Policy Created**: `cohuron-deployment-policy`
- ✅ **Policy Attached**: Replaces 11 AWS managed policies
- ✅ **EC2 S3 Access**: EC2 can download from code bucket

## 🔧 Current Status

### Code Deployment: ✅ WORKING
- Code is successfully deployed to `/opt/cohuron`
- All dependencies are installed
- Backup system is functional

### Build Process: ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION
- TypeScript build has compilation errors
- Errors in:
  - API routes (type safety issues)
  - Schema middleware
  - Various modules

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy (Ready to Use!)

### Deploy Your Code
```bash
cd /home/rabin/projects/pmo
./infra-tf/deploy-code.sh
```

**What Happens:**
1. Script bundles your current git branch
2. Uploads to S3: `cohuron-code-46en2lnm`
3. EventBridge triggers Lambda (30 seconds)
4. Lambda deploys to EC2 via SSM
5. Code is extracted to `/opt/cohuron`
6. Dependencies are installed

### Monitor Deployment
```bash
# View Lambda logs
aws --profile cohuron logs tail /aws/lambda/cohuron-code-deployer --since 5m

# SSH to EC2
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ubuntu@100.28.36.248

# Check deployed code
cd /opt/cohuron && ls -la

# View backups
ls -la /opt/cohuron-backups/
```

---

## 📝 Next Steps to Get Services Running

### 1. Fix TypeScript Build Errors
The code has TypeScript compilation errors that prevent building. You need to:

```bash
cd /home/rabin/projects/pmo/apps/api
pnpm build
# Fix reported type errors
```

**Common Errors Found:**
- Missing type declarations for modules
- JWT payload type safety issues (`request.user.sub`)
- Array type mismatches
- Missing imports

### 2. Build Projects
Once TypeScript errors are fixed:

```bash
# On EC2
cd /opt/cohuron
cd apps/api && pnpm build
cd ../web && pnpm build
```

### 3. Start Services
```bash
# Using PM2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 status
pm2 logs

# Or create systemd services
sudo systemctl start cohuron-api
sudo systemctl start cohuron-web
```

## 🎯 Deployment Infrastructure Summary

### AWS Resources Created
| Resource | Name/ID | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| VPC | vpc-0890bb5a0728073b5 | Network isolation |
| EC2 | i-005e2f454d893942c | Application server |
| RDS | cohuron-db | PostgreSQL database |
| S3 Artifacts | cohuron-artifacts-prod-* | File storage |
| S3 Code | cohuron-code-46en2lnm | Deployment bundles |
| Lambda | cohuron-code-deployer | Automated deployment |
| EventBridge | cohuron-code-upload-trigger | S3 event automation |
| Route 53 | app.cohuron.com | DNS |

### Cost Estimate
- **Monthly**: ~$82-86
- **Deployment**: $0.001 per deployment (Lambda + S3)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check Deployment Status
```bash
# Lambda logs
aws --profile cohuron logs tail /aws/lambda/cohuron-code-deployer --follow

# SSM commands
aws --profile cohuron ssm list-commands --instance-id i-005e2f454d893942c --max-results 5

# EC2 deployment
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 ubuntu@100.28.36.248
tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

### Common Issues

**Deployment Failed**
- Check Lambda logs for errors
- Verify EC2 IAM role has S3 access
- Ensure SSM agent is running on EC2

**Services Won't Start**
- Check TypeScript build errors
- Verify dependencies are installed
- Check PM2 logs: `pm2 logs`

**S3 Upload Failed**
- Verify AWS profile: `aws --profile cohuron sts get-caller-identity`
- Check S3 bucket exists
- Verify IAM permissions

---

## 🎉 Success Summary

**Completed:**
1. ✅ Full AWS infrastructure deployed
2. ✅ Automated deployment system working
3. ✅ IAM permissions configured
4. ✅ Code successfully deploying to EC2
5. ✅ Dependencies automatically installed
6. ✅ Backup system functional

**Ready to Use:**
- One-command deployments: `./infra-tf/deploy-code.sh`
- Automatic code delivery to EC2
- Safe rollback via backups

**Remaining:**
- Fix TypeScript build errors in source code
- Build projects on EC2
- Start services with PM2 or systemd
