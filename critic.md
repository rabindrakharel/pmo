Below is a pragmatic critique focused on production scale, next‑gen readiness, and risk reduction for the artifacts feature and adjacent patterns.

Architecture

Multi‑tenancy: d_project has tenant_id, but d_artifact lacks it. Risk: cross‑tenant data leakage. Improvement: add tenant_id and enforce on all queries. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1, apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
RBAC deferred: Feature ships with basic auth only; in prod this is insufficient. Risk: unauthorized reads/writes. Improvement: wire hasPermissionOnAPI/hasPermissionOnScopeId and seed scopes post‑MVP.
Schema deployment: tools/db-import.sh drops and recreates schema. Risk: data loss, downtime. Improvement: adopt migrations (e.g., Drizzle Kit/Flyway), versioned, zero‑downtime rollout. Files: tools/db-import.sh:1.
Database

Referential integrity: project_stage is free‑text. Risk: drift from meta_project_stage. Improvement: store stage code with FK or CHECK on valid codes; expose a view for human‑readable name. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1.
Domain enums: artifact_type, source_type are free‑text. Risk: bad data. Improvement: use CHECK constraints or a meta table for valid values, plus NOT NULL for owner_emp_id.
Performance: Recommended indexes not created. Risk: slow lists/filters under load. Improvement: add GIN/BTREE indexes for search/sorts; consider trigram/FTS. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1.
Data consistency: No constraint ensuring project_id belongs to business_id. Risk: inconsistent scoping. Improvement: trigger/function to validate on insert/update; or store both and enforce with a join check.
Lifecycle: Good SCD fields present, but no trigger to maintain updated. Improvement: add BEFORE UPDATE trigger to set updated=NOW() consistently. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1.
API

Authorization: Only fastify.authenticate enforced. Risk: accidental exposure. Improvement: staged rollout—first API gating via hasPermissionOnAPI, then row‑level checks; keep feature flags to turn on gradually. Files: apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
Validation: TypeBox exists but domain validation missing. Risk: invalid enums, invalid URLs. Improvement: strict schema for artifact_type/source_type, URL validation, size limits on attachments.
Pagination at scale: COUNT(*) for every list is expensive. Improvement: optional estimated counts, keyset pagination for large datasets, or materialized totals. Files: apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
Data bloat: Returning full attachments arrays in list can be heavy. Improvement: trim heavy fields in list view (return counts), expand on detail.
Consistency: Other modules use universal column masking. Risk: inconsistent responses/PII leakage later. Improvement: unify artifact responses through the same filter/mask utilities.
Frontend

Gating: Page is visible to any authenticated user. Risk: UX mismatch when RBAC lands. Improvement: integrate page/component gating when RBAC is ready; hide nav based on /auth/permissions. Files: apps/web/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx:1, apps/web/src/App.tsx:1.
UX: Search applies only on Enter/Apply; no debounce; limited filters. Improvement: add debounce, async multi‑select filters bound to user’s accessible scopes, server‑side sorting controls. Files: apps/web/src/pages/ArtifactsPage.tsx:1.
Data model drift: UI treats project_stage as display field but DB stores text with no mapping. Improvement: fetch meta stages for labels and filter options.
Security

No RBAC: Biggest current risk. Ensure rollout plan and toggles to enable RBAC quickly post‑validation.
File/URI handling: uri and attachments freeform JSON. Risk: untrusted links, phishing, SSRF if used server‑side. Improvement: allowlisted domains, signed URLs, store in object storage; sanitize metadata on input. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1, apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
Auditability: No dedicated audit trail/versioning for artifacts. Improvement: either SCD‑like ops_artifact_head/ops_artifact_records for revisions or an artifact_versions table.
Operations

Schema tool: destructive imports not suitable for prod. Improvement: separate dev/demo tooling from prod migrations; CI migration tests. Files: tools/db-import.sh:1.
Observability: Minimal logging, no request IDs, metrics, or tracing. Improvement: add structured logs, correlation IDs, error taxonomy, and basic metrics (latency, qps, error rate).
Data Quality

Ownership defaulting: owner_emp_id set only on create; not enforced non‑NULL. Risk: orphaned records. Improvement: NOT NULL with default to creator; guard in API. Files: apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
Uniqueness: No uniqueness guard on (business_id, project_id, name). Risk: duplicates. Improvement: optional unique index per scope + name if required by biz rules.
Scale & Next‑Gen Enhancements

Search: Move to Postgres FTS/GIN over name/descr/tags; future vector search for doc embeddings.
Attachment management: External object storage (S3/GCS) + lifecycle policies; virus scanning hook; DLP patterns for sensitive docs.
Caching: ETag/Last‑Modified on GET, CDN for public artifacts (if any).
API ergonomics: Add sort fields, consistent pagination shape across modules, HAL/links for navigation.
Concrete Next Steps

DB: Add tenant_id, NOT NULLs, CHECKs/enums, FK/code mapping for project_stage, enforce business–project consistency, add indexes. Files: db/12_artifact.ddl:1.
API: Add enum validation, trim list payloads, sorting, and later RBAC hooks; add updated trigger. Files: apps/api/src/modules/artifact/routes.ts:1.
FE: Debounced search, richer filters (type, stage, business, project), display stage names via meta, prepare for gating. Files: apps/web/src/pages/ArtifactsPage.tsx:1.
Ops: Adopt migrations, structured logging, and a basic test suite for artifacts endpoints.
If you want, I can harden the schema (tenant_id, checks, indexes), add sort options and trimmed list payloads, and wire minimal tests before introducing RBAC.
