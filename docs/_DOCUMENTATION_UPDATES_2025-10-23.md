## Summary of Changes

### What Was Updated

| Document | Sections Changed | Lines Modified |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| form.md | Architecture, Design Patterns | ~90 lines |
| ui_ux_route_api.md | Infrastructure, API Routes | ~20 lines |
| S3_ATTACHMENT_SERVICE_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md | Status, Summary | ~50 lines |
| S3_UPLOAD_DRY_ARCHITECTURE.md | Entire file (new) | ~600 lines |

### Key Messages Updated

**Before:**
- "Upload to S3, store only object keys (DRY principle - single generic function)"
- Multiple upload implementations mentioned
- MinIO as primary dev storage

**After:**
- "Unified S3 upload system using reusable hook (DRY principle)"
- Single hook (`useS3Upload`) for all uploads
- AWS S3 as unified backend, MinIO optional

---

## Documentation Consistency

All documentation now reflects:
1. ✅ Single S3 backend for all uploads
2. ✅ Reusable hook pattern (`useS3Upload`)
3. ✅ Core service pattern (`S3AttachmentService`)
4. ✅ Production-ready status
5. ✅ DRY principles applied throughout
6. ✅ Deprecated MinIO storage (marked as optional dev only)

---

## Next Steps for Users

**Developers should:**
1. Read `S3_UPLOAD_DRY_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete overview
2. Use `useS3Upload` hook for any new upload features
3. Reference `form.md` for form-specific upload examples
4. Check `ui_ux_route_api.md` for API endpoint details

**When debugging:**
1. Check S3 health: `GET /api/v1/s3-backend/health`
2. Review logs in `S3AttachmentService` for service-level errors
3. Test with `./tools/test-artifact-s3.sh`
