## Architecture Comparison

### Old Approach (WebSocket + Realtime API)
- WebSocket connection for streaming
- OpenAI Realtime API
- High cost: ~$0.30 per conversation
- Continuous audio streaming
- Complex audio handling

### New Approach (HTTP + Orchestrator)
- HTTP POST for push-to-talk
- Whisper STT + OpenAI TTS
- Low cost: ~$0.02-0.05 per conversation (80-85% savings)
- Simple audio upload/download
- Full orchestrator integration

---

## Routes & Access

### Frontend Routes:
- `/voice-chat` - Voice assistant page (protected)
- `/chat` - Text chat page (existing, protected)

### API Routes:
```
POST   /api/v1/chat/orchestrator/voice     # Complete voice flow
POST   /api/v1/chat/orchestrator/stt       # Speech-to-text only
POST   /api/v1/chat/orchestrator/tts       # Text-to-speech only
GET    /api/v1/chat/orchestrator/voices    # List available voices
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Required for Whisper and TTS
```

### Optional Settings:
```bash
ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo  # Override default model
WORKER_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo        # Override worker model
```

---

## Usage Examples

### 1. Frontend Usage

Navigate to `/voice-chat` in the web app:
1. Select a voice from the dropdown
2. Hold the microphone button and speak
3. Release to send
4. Listen to AI response
5. View transcript

### 2. API Usage (curl)

**Get voices:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/api/v1/chat/orchestrator/voices
```

**Complete voice flow:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/chat/orchestrator/voice \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@audio.webm" \
  -F "voice=nova" \
  --output response.mp3
```

**TTS only:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/chat/orchestrator/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"Hello world","voice":"nova"}' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

### 3. Testing

Run the test script:
```bash
./tools/test-voice-orchestrator.sh
```

Test with real audio:
```bash
# Record 5 seconds of audio
sox -d -r 16000 -c 1 /tmp/test-audio.wav trim 0 5

# Run tests again
./tools/test-voice-orchestrator.sh
```

## Response Headers

The voice endpoint returns metadata in HTTP headers:

| Header | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `X-Session-Id` | Orchestrator session ID | `abc-123-def` |
| `X-Transcript` | User speech transcript (URL-encoded) | `I%20need%20landscaping` |
| `X-Response-Text` | AI response text (URL-encoded) | `Can%20I%20get%20your%20name` |
| `X-Intent` | Detected intent | `CalendarBooking` |
| `X-Current-Node` | Current workflow node | `collect_name` |
| `X-Completed` | Workflow completed flag | `true`/`false` |
| `X-Conversation-Ended` | Conversation end flag | `true`/`false` |
| `X-End-Reason` | Reason for ending | `off_topic`, `max_turns` |

---

## Available Voices

| ID | Name | Description |
|----|------|-------------|
| `alloy` | Alloy | Neutral and balanced |
| `echo` | Echo | Warm and friendly |
| `fable` | Fable | Expressive and dynamic |
| `onyx` | Onyx | Deep and authoritative |

## Performance

### Typical Latency:
- STT (Whisper): 500-1500ms
- Orchestrator: 500-2000ms
- MCP Tools: 200-500ms each
- TTS: 500-1500ms
- **Total:** 1.7-5.5 seconds

### Cost Comparison:
- **New approach:** $0.02-0.05 per conversation
- **Old approach:** $0.30 per conversation
- **Savings:** 80-85% 🎉

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. Push-to-talk only (no continuous listening)
2. No voice activity detection
3. No streaming TTS (complete response only)
4. English language only (configurable)

### Planned Enhancements:
1. Streaming TTS for faster feedback
2. Voice activity detection (auto-stop recording)
3. Multi-language support
4. Voice biometrics for user identification
5. Emotion detection from voice tone
6. Background noise reduction

---

## Integration with Orchestrator

The voice system fully integrates with the multi-agent orchestrator:

- **Authenticator Agent:** Validates user and session
- **Orchestrator Agent:** Detects intent and routes
- **Worker Agent:** Executes MCP tools (bookings, tasks, etc.)
- **Evaluator Agent:** Validates outputs
- **Critic Agent:** Enforces boundaries (off-topic detection)

All orchestrator features work via voice:
- ✅ Service bookings
- ✅ Calendar queries
- ✅ Task management
- ✅ Multi-turn conversations
- ✅ State persistence
- ✅ Function calling
- ✅ Boundary enforcement
