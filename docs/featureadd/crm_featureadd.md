     version integer DEFAULT 1
   );
   ```

2. **Sales Pipeline Kanban** (HIGH)
   - Current: Generic Kanban only (project_stage, task_stage)
   - Need: Specialized deal pipeline with:
     - Weighted value (amount × probability)
     - Days in stage tracking
     - Deal rotting indicators (> 30 days in stage)

4. **Deal Rotting & Stale Deal Alerts** (MEDIUM)
   - Current: No time-based alerts
   - Need: Background job to detect stale deals
   ```typescript
   // Pseudo-code
   async function detectStaleDeal() {
     const staleDays = 30;
     const staleDeals = await db.query(`
       SELECT id, name, stage, updated_ts, owner_employee_id
       FROM app.d_deal
       WHERE stage NOT IN ('Closed Won', 'Closed Lost')
         AND updated_ts < NOW() - INTERVAL '${staleDays} days'
         AND active_flag = true
     `);

     for (const deal of staleDeals) {
       await notifications.create({
         user_id: deal.owner_employee_id,
         type: 'deal_stale',
         message: `Deal "${deal.name}" has been in ${deal.stage} for ${staleDays}+ days`,
         entity_type: 'deal',
         entity_id: deal.id
       });
     }
   }
   ```

      - **Intent**: Pricing page visit (30pts), competitor comparison (40pts)
    - Algorithm:
    ```typescript
    function calculateLeadScore(contact: Contact): number {
      let score = 0;

      // Engagement score
      score += contact.email_opens * 5;
      score += contact.email_clicks * 10;
      score += contact.form_submissions * 25;
      score += contact.demo_requests * 50;

      // Fit score
      if (contact.company_size >= 100 && contact.company_size <= 500) score += 20;
      if (idealIndustries.includes(contact.industry)) score += 15;
      if (contact.budget >= 50000) score += 25;

    }
    ```

12. **Duplicate Detection & Merge** (MEDIUM)
    - Current: No duplicate handling
    - Need: Fuzzy matching on email, name, phone

        SELECT * FROM app.d_contact
        WHERE id != $1
          AND (
            email = $2  -- Exact email match
            OR levenshtein(LOWER(first_name || ' ' || last_name), LOWER($3)) <= 2  -- Name similarity
            OR phone = $4  -- Exact phone match
          )

## Customer Data Platform (CDP) Gaps

CDPs like **Segment**, **Twilio Engage**, and **Adobe Experience Platform** unify customer data from all touchpoints. They power personalization, analytics, and marketing automation.

### Category 4: Unified Customer Data (18 Missing Features)

#### 4.1 Data Collection & Ingestion

**What CDPs Have:**
- Event tracking (page views, clicks, form submissions, purchases)
- Identity resolution (merge anonymous → identified users)
- Multi-channel data ingestion (web, mobile, email, CRM, support)
- Real-time data streaming
- Data warehouse sync (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift)

**What You're Missing:**

44. **Event Tracking SDK** (CRITICAL)
    - Current: No behavioral tracking
    - Need: JavaScript SDK for tracking user actions
    ```typescript
    // Frontend: apps/web/src/lib/analytics.ts
    import Analytics from '@segment/analytics-next';

    export const analytics = Analytics({
      writeKey: process.env.VITE_ANALYTICS_KEY
    });

    // Track page views
    analytics.page('Project Detail', {
      project_id: '123',
      project_name: 'Q1 Launch'
    });

    // Track events
    analytics.track('Deal Created', {
      deal_id: '456',
      amount: 50000,
      stage: 'Proposal'
    });

    // Identify users
    analytics.identify(userId, {
      name: 'John Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      role: 'Sales Rep'
    });
    ```
    - Schema:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE app.event (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      event_name varchar(100) NOT NULL,
      user_id uuid,
      anonymous_id varchar(100),  -- For pre-login tracking
      contact_id uuid,
      account_id uuid,
      properties jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
      context jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,  -- {ip, user_agent, device, location}
      timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now()
    );

    CREATE INDEX idx_event_user ON app.event(user_id, timestamp DESC);
    CREATE INDEX idx_event_name ON app.event(event_name, timestamp DESC);
    CREATE INDEX idx_event_contact ON app.event(contact_id, timestamp DESC);
    ```

45. **Identity Resolution** (CRITICAL)
    - Current: No user merging
    - Need: Merge anonymous → identified users
    - Algorithm:
    ```typescript
    async function resolveIdentity(email: string, anonymousId: string) {
      // Find or create contact
      let contact = await db.query('SELECT * FROM app.d_contact WHERE email = $1', [email]);
      if (!contact) {
        contact = await createContact({ email, lifecycle_stage: 'Lead' });
      }

      // Merge anonymous events to identified contact
      await db.query(`
        UPDATE app.event
        SET contact_id = $1, user_id = $2
        WHERE anonymous_id = $3 AND contact_id IS NULL
      `, [contact.id, contact.user_id, anonymousId]);

      // Recalculate lead score with new behavioral data
      await recalculateLeadScore(contact.id);
    }
    ```

46. **Multi-Channel Data Sources** (HIGH)
    - Current: Only internal app data

      - **Support**: Ticket creation, resolution time (via Zendesk webhook)
      - **Ads**: Campaign clicks, conversions (via Facebook/Google Ads API)
    - Schema:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE app.data_source (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      source_type varchar(50),  -- email, web, mobile, support, ads
      source_name varchar(100),  -- "Gmail", "Website", "Zendesk"
      api_credentials jsonb,  -- Encrypted API keys
      sync_frequency varchar(20),  -- realtime, hourly, daily
      last_sync_ts timestamptz,
      active_flag boolean DEFAULT true
    );
    ```

47. **Real-Time Data Streaming** (MEDIUM)
    - Current: Batch processing only
    - Need: Sub-second event ingestion

- Predictive scoring (churn risk, purchase propensity)
- Custom attributes (computed fields)

**What You're Missing:**

49. **Unified Customer Profile** (CRITICAL)
    - Current: Fragmented data (client table, project links, task assignments)
    - Need: Single customer view showing:
      - **Identity**: Name, email, company, role
      - **Engagement**: Last activity, email opens, website visits
      - **Sales**: Deals, pipeline value, win probability
      - **Support**: Tickets, resolution time, satisfaction score
      - **Projects**: Active projects, budget, completion rate
      - **Behavioral**: Most visited pages, most used features
    - UI: `CustomerProfile360.tsx` component
    - Example:
    ```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Acme Corp                               Score: 87/100 │

    │ • 1 week ago: Meeting with Sales Rep (1 hour)       │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ```

50. **Behavioral Segmentation** (HIGH)
    - Current: Static client categorization
    - Need: Dynamic segments based on behavior
    - Examples:
      - "High-Value Engaged": Contacts with lead_score > 70 AND last_activity < 7 days ago
      - "At-Risk Customers": Accounts with projects AND last_activity > 30 days ago
      - "Demo Requested": Contacts with event "Demo Requested" AND deal_stage IS NULL
    - Schema:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE app.customer_segment (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      name varchar(200),
      description text,
      query_conditions jsonb,  -- {filters: [{field: "lead_score", operator: ">", value: 70}], logic: "AND"}
      auto_update boolean DEFAULT true,  -- Recalculate daily
      created_ts timestamptz DEFAULT now()
    );

    CREATE TABLE app.segment_membership (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      segment_id uuid NOT NULL,
      contact_id uuid NOT NULL,
      account_id uuid,
      joined_ts timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
      UNIQUE(segment_id, contact_id)
    );
    ```

51. **Predictive Scoring** (MEDIUM)
    - Current: No ML models
    - Need: Predict customer behavior
      - **Churn Risk**: Probability customer will leave (0-100%)
      - **Purchase Propensity**: Likelihood of upsell (0-100%)
      - **Engagement Score**: Activity level vs historical baseline
    - Algorithm (basic):
    ```typescript
    function calculateChurnRisk(accountId: string): number {
      const account = await getAccount(accountId);
      const recentActivity = await getActivityCount(accountId, 30);  // Last 30 days
      const avgActivity = account.avg_monthly_activity;
      const daysSinceLastActivity = account.days_since_last_activity;

      let risk = 0;

      // Low activity
      if (recentActivity < avgActivity * 0.5) risk += 40;

      // No recent activity
      if (daysSinceLastActivity > 30) risk += 30;
      if (daysSinceLastActivity > 60) risk += 20;

      // Support tickets
      if (account.open_support_tickets > 3) risk += 10;

      return Math.min(risk, 100);
    }
    ```

52. **Custom Computed Attributes** (MEDIUM)
    - Current: No derived fields
    - Need: Auto-calculated properties
    - Examples:
      - `lifetime_value`: Sum of all closed deal amounts
      - `avg_deal_size`: lifetime_value / num_closed_deals
      - `days_as_customer`: today - first_project_start_date
      - `engagement_trend`: activity_last_30_days / activity_previous_30_days (> 1 = increasing)
    - Schema:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE app.computed_attribute (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      entity_type varchar(20),  -- contact, account, deal
      attribute_name varchar(100),
      calculation_logic jsonb,  -- {type: "sum", field: "deal_amount", filter: {stage: "Closed Won"}}
      refresh_frequency varchar(20),  -- realtime, hourly, daily
      created_ts timestamptz DEFAULT now()
    );
    ```

      test_id uuid NOT NULL,
      variant varchar(10),
      user_id uuid,
      converted boolean DEFAULT false,
      timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT now()
    );
    ```

56. **Journey Orchestration** (HIGH)
    - Current: No automated journeys
    - Need: Multi-step campaigns triggered by behavior
    - Example journey: "New Lead Onboarding"
      1. Trigger: Contact created with lifecycle_stage = "Lead"
      2. Wait 1 day
      3. Send email "Welcome to PMO Platform"
      4. If email opened → Wait 2 days → Send email "Getting Started Guide"
      5. If email not opened → Wait 3 days → Send email "Still interested?"
      6. If "Demo Requested" event → Transition to "Sales Follow-Up" journey
    - UI: Visual journey builder (drag-drop flowchart)

57. **Consent Management** (CRITICAL)
    - Current: No consent tracking
    - Need: Track user permissions
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE app.user_consent (
      id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
      contact_id uuid NOT NULL,
      consent_type varchar(50),  -- marketing_email, analytics_tracking, data_sharing
      granted boolean,
      granted_ts timestamptz,
      revoked_ts timestamptz,
      ip_address varchar(50),
      UNIQUE(contact_id, consent_type)
    );
    ```
    - UI: Cookie banner, preference center

58. **Data Retention Policies** (HIGH)
    - Current: Keep all data forever
    - Need: Auto-delete old data
    - Policies:
      - Event data: Delete after 2 years
      - Inactive contacts: Delete after 5 years of no activity
      - Audit logs: Delete after 7 years (compliance requirement)
    - Implementation: Background job

59. **PII Masking** (MEDIUM)
    - Current: Full access to PII
    - Need: Role-based PII access
    - Example: Sales reps see full email, support reps see masked email (j***@example.com)

60. **Data Portability (GDPR Right to Access)** (HIGH)
    - Current: No data export for users
    - Need: One-click export of all user data
    - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/contact/{id}/export` → ZIP file with JSON/CSV

61. **Right to be Forgotten (GDPR)** (CRITICAL)
    - Current: Soft deletes only
    - Need: Hard delete + anonymization
    - Process:
      1. User requests deletion
      2. Manager approves (if customer, check for active projects)
      3. Anonymize all linked data (replace name with "Deleted User #12345")
      4. Hard delete PII (email, phone, address)
      5. Keep aggregated analytics (without PII)
